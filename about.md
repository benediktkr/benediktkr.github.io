A software developer based in Berlin, Germany. Working as a
freelancer, strengths include networking and devops.

One of two founders of [lokun.is](https://lokun.is/) --- an
Iceland-based VPN that disrupted the bandwidth market. To graduate
university, I tried
[using an Arduino to generate random numbers](http://benedikt.sudo.is/ardrand.pdf).
